A mobile carousel based on Hammer.js
------------------------------------
Based on the Hammer.js Carousel, this is a simple work-in-progress concept for an upcoming mobile web app. 

It's looking to have similar features to the Google Maps native app style of carousel for places, where you can add and remove carousel slides/panes dynamically.
